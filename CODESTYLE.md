###Class, function and variable names
All variable names should be lowercase and have underline between words, same
for functions
```
new_variable = "Good"
newVariable = "Bad"
NewVariable = "Bad" 
```
classnames should start from uppercase and be written in Pascal-case style, 
for example
```
class NewClass:
    "Good"

class new_class:
    "Bad"

class newClass:
    "Bad"
```

###Specific functions and variables naming
From variables should be named like this:

```
cors -> pos
dimentions, rect_size -> size
```

###Access to object variables
Use getters and setters instead of right through access
